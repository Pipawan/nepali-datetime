The Nepali calendar system follows the Bikram Sambat pattern (B.S.), while the English calendar system follows the A.D. system, which generally refers to Anno Domini, and BC refers to Before Christ. In the B.S. and A.D. calendar systems, there is a difference of around 57 years. This is because King Bikram Aditya established this calendar system before the birth of Jesus. Generally, the B.S. calendar is the calendar of Hindus.
